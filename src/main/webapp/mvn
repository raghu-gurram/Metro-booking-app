### Prerequisite: Setting Up Git User in Terminal

Before we begin with the Git commands for each scenario, you first need to change the current GitHub terminal user.

1. **Remove Current GitHub User**:
   Run the following command to remove the current credentials:

   ```bash
   git config --global --unset credential.helper
   ```

2. **Add Your New GitHub Account**:
   First, configure your Git user globally:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
   ```

3. **Check the configuration**:
   To confirm the updates, run:

   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

Now that you're set up, let's tackle the problems.

### 1. Initialize a Git repository and add your project files

#### Explanation:

You are starting a new repository and need to add your files to version control.

#### Solution:

To initialize a new repository, track your files, and push them to GitHub:

**Steps**:

1. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

2. Initialize the repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. Add all project files to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

4. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

5. Add the remote GitHub repository:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/anujyog1/MetroRepo.git
   ```

6. Push to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### 2. Set global config, and push your Maven project to GitHub

#### Explanation:

For a Maven project, you need to ensure your global Git configuration is set and then push the project to GitHub.

#### Solution:

1. Ensure global config is set as mentioned above (`user.name` and `user.email`).

2. Initialize and push your Maven project as explained in step 1.

3. Make sure your `.gitignore` file includes `target/` so Maven's output files are not tracked by Git.

**Steps**:

```bash
echo "target/" >> .gitignore
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add Maven .gitignore"
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 3a. Mistakenly Committed on `main` Instead of `ui-fixes`

#### Explanation:

You accidentally committed UI fixes on the `main` branch when they should have gone to a different branch (`ui-fixes`).

#### Solution:

You need to move the commit from `main` to `ui-fixes` without losing it.

**Steps**:

1. Create and checkout to the `ui-fixes` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b ui-fixes
   ```

2. Cherry-pick the commit from `main`:

   ```bash
   git cherry-pick <commit_hash>
   ```

3. Push the `ui-fixes` branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin ui-fixes
   ```

4. Go back to `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

5. Remove the commit from `main`:

   ```bash
   git reset --hard HEAD~1
   ```

6. Push the changes to `main`:

   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

### 3b. Your Local History Doesn't Match Due to Force Push by Teammate

#### Explanation:

Your teammate force-pushed changes to the `main` branch, which caused your local history to diverge.

#### Solution:

You need to safely align your local history with the remote repository.

**Steps**:

1. First, ensure you're on the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Fetch the latest changes from the remote:

   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

3. Rebase your local changes onto the remote `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

4. If there are conflicts, resolve them, then continue the rebase:

   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```

5. Once the rebase is complete, push your local changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 3c. Conflict in `BookingController.java` While Merging

#### Explanation:

You face a conflict in `BookingController.java` when merging your `payment-module` branch into `main`.

#### Solution:

You need to resolve the merge conflict manually and complete the merge.

**Steps**:

1. First, merge the `payment-module` branch into `main`:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge payment-module
   ```

2. If there is a conflict in `BookingController.java`, open the file and manually resolve it.

3. Once the conflict is resolved, add the file to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add BookingController.java
   ```

4. Complete the merge:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in BookingController.java"
   ```

5. Push the merged changes to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

### 3d. Accidentally Deleted `booking-module` Branch, Commits Not Merged

#### Explanation:

You accidentally deleted the `booking-module` branch, but its commits were never merged into `main`.

#### Solution:

You can recover the lost commits by checking the reflog and creating a new branch from the commit history.

**Steps**:

1. Check the Git reflog for the deleted branch:

   ```bash
   git reflog
   ```

2. Find the commit hash where `booking-module` was last active.

3. Create a new branch from that commit:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b booking-module <commit_hash>
   ```

4. Push the new branch to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin booking-module
   ```

---

### 3e. Combine Multiple Commits Into One

#### Explanation:

You made multiple commits in `FlightSearchController.java` that you need to combine into a single commit for clarity.

#### Solution:

You can squash the commits into a single commit using an interactive rebase.

**Steps**:

1. Start an interactive rebase:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~3
   ```

2. Change `pick` to `squash` for the second and third commits.

3. Save and close the editor to combine the commits.

4. Push the changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

---

### 3f. Restore a Deleted Commit

#### Explanation:

You accidentally deleted a commit (e.g., "Repo metro cancellation feature") and need to restore it.

#### Solution:

You can use the reflog to find and restore the deleted commit.

**Steps**:

1. Check the Git reflog:

   ```bash
   git reflog
   ```

2. Find the commit hash of the deleted commit.

3. Checkout to that commit:

   ```bash
   git checkout <commit_hash>
   ```

4. Create a new branch from it:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b restore-cancellation-feature
   ```

5. Push the changes:

   ```bash
   git push origin restore-cancellation-feature
   ```

### 3g. Pause Implementing `DiscountService.java` for Hotfix

#### Explanation:

You were working on `DiscountService.java` but need to pause to implement a hotfix.

#### Solution:

You can stash your changes, implement the hotfix, and then return to the work on `DiscountService.java`.

**Steps**:

1. Stash your current changes:

   ```bash
   git stash
   ```

2. Switch to the hotfix branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout hotfix-branch
   ```

3. Implement the hotfix and commit it:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Hotfix"
   ```

4. Switch back to your original branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout discount-service
   ```

5. Apply the stashed changes:

   ```bash
   git stash pop
   ```

---

### 3h. Remove Unnecessary Merge Commits

#### Explanation:

You notice many unnecessary merge commits cluttering the Git history.

#### Solution:

You can use an interactive rebase to squash or remove unnecessary merge commits.

**Steps**:

1. Start an interactive rebase:

   ```bash
   git rebase -i --root
   ```

2. Remove or squash the unnecessary merge commits.

3. Push the cleaned-up history:

   ```bash
   git push origin main --force
   ```

---

### 3i. Generate and Apply Patch Files

#### Explanation:

Your manager asks for the last two commits as patch files.

#### Solution:

You can create patches for the last two commits and apply them.

**Steps**:

1. Create patch files:

   ```bash
   git format-patch -2
   ```

2. Apply the patch:

   ```bash
   git am <patch_file>
   ```

### 3j. Forced Push Overwriting Teammate's Commit

#### Explanation:

You mistakenly forced-pushed to the `main` branch and overwrote a teammate's commit.
